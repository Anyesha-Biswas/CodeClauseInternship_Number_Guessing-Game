Create a game where the computer selects a random number, and the player
guesses it. Provide hints on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

Technologies-

What You Learn-
Random number generation, User input handling, Conditional statements

This code uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100. 
It then prompts the user to enter their guess and compares it to the secret number. 
If the guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message. If the guess is incorrect, it provides hints on whether the guess is too high or too low. 
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
